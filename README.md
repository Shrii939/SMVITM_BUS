# Advanced Geospatial-Based Multimodal Urban Mobility Optimization

This project aims to enhance urban mobility through advanced geospatial-based techniques, offering a multimodal solution for efficient transportation management.

## Features

### For Users (Students):

- **Bus Tracking**: Allows students to monitor the real-time location of buses.
- **Notification Before Bus Arrival**: Sends notifications to students prior to the bus reaching their designated stop.
- **QR Code for Student Counting**: Students can use QR codes for check-in when boarding, enabling automated passenger counting.

### For Admins:

- **Student Registration and Deletion**: Admins can manage student profiles, including adding new students and removing existing ones.
- **Counting Through QR Code**: Admins have access to data collected from QR code scans for student counting purposes.
- **Live Tracking**: Provides real-time tracking of buses and their routes for admins.

### For Drivers:

- **Start and Stop Bus**: Allows drivers to initiate and terminate bus routes.
- **Bus Fault Notification**: Drivers can report any faults or issues with the bus through the system.

## Database

This system utilizes Firebase as the database platform, with data management responsibilities delegated to the client (admin). The database likely stores information such as student profiles, bus routes, real-time tracking data, and notifications.

## Installation

- Clone the repository.
- Install dependencies using `npm install`.
- Set up Firebase and configure the database according to provided instructions.
- Run the application using `npm start`.

## Usage

- Users can access the system through a web or mobile interface.
- Admins can log in to manage student profiles, track buses, and view analytics.
- Drivers can use the application to start and stop routes and report bus faults.
